## The challenge

The challenge is to build out a landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size (Mobile: 375px, Desktop: 1440px)
- See active states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Development Notes:

### Tools used:
<ul>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3 - Flexbox, Grid, Variables, Media Queries</li>
<li>JavaScript - Used for mobile navigation toggle</li>
</ul>

### Workflow:
<ul>
<li>Started by declaring CSS variables and global properties such as font-sizes according to design specifications</li>
<li>Divided the page layout into small components and coded the HTML for each of them</li>
<li>Implemented desktop design first and then added responsiveness for mobile later with media queries</li>
</ul>
